var date = "2019-02-01 10:00:00 PM +02:00";
This means local time is 22:00 and has a +2 hour offset. So, UTC time is 20:00

DateTime.Kind can be:
	Local
	UTC
	Unspecified 
	
Use DateTimeOffSet class to capture UTC offset information

ISO 8601 is the standard time you should use for storage

date.ToString("o") will give a ISO 8601 compliant representation

Using DateTimeOffset.UtcNow will give you the current UTC time plus the offset to get back to local time.
