Angular Forms

2.2
reactive - better for unit testing
Form validation

3.2
Import FormsModule in the app.module.ts

3.3
Create component. Add selector to the app.component.html
Created form with ok button

3.4
Install Bootstrap:
npm install --save bootstrap
Add to angular.json:
 "styles": [
              "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css",
              "src/styles.css"
            ],
When using form controls with bootstrap us div class="form-group" to give it Bootstrap styling
<lable for="name" matches with <input id="name".  For focus.

4.2
NgForm - importing the module makes Angular take over forms
	internal: <form NgForm></form>
You can access it via #form variable: <form #form="ngForm"> then using {{form}}

4.3
When building a form the NgModel directive gets placed on every field that we want angular to know about.
	e.g.  <input id="name" name="name" class="form-control" ngModel />
ngModule comes from FormsModule

4.4
Created Data Model.  I.e. interface variable in the component.ts

4.5
2-way data binding using [(ngModel)]="userSettings.name"

4.6
You want to work with a copy of the settings and not the original in case the user cancels or navigates back etc
To copy an interface you can use the spread operator: ...
	userSettings: UserSettings = { ...this.originalUserSettings };
	This is a shallow copy
